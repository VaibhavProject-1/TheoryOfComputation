[import re

pattern = '^a...s$'
test_string = 'abyss'
result = re.match(pattern, test_string)

if result:
  print("Search successful.")
else:
  print("Search unsuccessful.")	
]


Example for start and end
Search the string to see if it starts with "The" and ends with "Spain":

import re

txt = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.search("^The.*Spain$", txt)

# Program to extract numbers from a string

import re

string = 'hello 12 hi 89. Howdy 34'
pattern = '\d+'

result = re.findall(pattern, string) 
print(result)

# Output: ['12', '89', '34']

Expression meaning
[]=match anything in the square bracket
eg:[abc] can match a,ab, or abc

 Caret

The caret symbol ^ is used to check if a string starts with a certain character.
eg: ^a will match any string starting with a

 Dollar

The dollar symbol $ is used to check if a string ends with a certain character.
eg: a$ will match all strings ending with a

Star

The star symbol * matches zero or more occurrences of the pattern left to it.
eg: ma*n will match any number of occurences of a so mn,man,maan,etc; So anything other than a won't be matched

 Plus

The plus symbol + matches one or more occurrences of the pattern left to it.
eg: like above but mn will not be matched

 Question Mark

The question mark symbol ? matches zero or one occurrence of the pattern left to it.
eg:like both above but only for mn or man


Braces

Consider this code: {n,m}. This means at least n, and at most m repetitions of the pattern left to it.
eg: a{2,3} will match minimum 2 or maximum 3 occurences

Alternation

Vertical bar | is used for alternation (or operator).
eg: a|b will match either a or b in the string

Group

Parentheses () is used to group sub-patterns. For example, (a|b|c)xz match any string that matches either a or b or c followed by xz
eg: (a|b|c)xz will match either axz or bxz or cxz

\ - Backslash

Backlash \ is used to escape various characters including all metacharacters. For example,

\$a match if a string contains $ followed by a. Here, $ is not interpreted by a RegEx engine in a special way.

If you are unsure if a character has special meaning or not, you can put \ in front of it. This makes sure the character is not treated in a special way.


\A - Matches if the specified characters are at the start of a string.
eg: \Athe will match "the sun" but not "In the sun"

\b - Matches if the specified characters are at the beginning or end of a word.
